We used Pakistan's Largest Ecommerce from Kaggle.com.  The results of this project analysis are related to the performance of Nexa Commerce in the last one year. We used the data set from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zusmani/pakistans-largest-ecommerce-dataset

This project aims to analyze how to increase the number of completed orders by 31-40% in the next 4 months. Which includes transaction data from Sept 2017-Aug 2018. Our data scope includes data on order status, total revenue, net sales, average discount and product category. 

## Main hypothesis:
1. A more efficient Easypay payment method will increase order completions.
2. Improved quality of men's fashion products will reduce returns.
3. Strategic discounts or promotions for mobiles and tablets at certain moments will increase order completions.
We use total revenue, sales growth, and perfect order rate metrics to measure success.

## Recommendation
1. Use influencer marketing to attract more customers.
2. Evaluate product quality at stores that sell men's fashion categories to increase customer loyalty. 
3. Evaluate Easypay and Bank Alfalah payment methods to make it more efficient and easier for customers to complete their orders. 
4. Diversify mobiles and tablets products to expand market segmentation. 
5. Hold flash sales to boost sales.

## Conclusion
1. The mobiles and tablets category has the highest contribution to sales, so the right recommendation is to optimize the product both in terms of sales and or promotion. 
2. Easypay and Bank Alfalah are the payment methods with the highest cancellation rate, the right recommendation is to evaluate the efficiency of both payment methods 
3. Men's fashion is a category with high demand, but also high return rate, the right recommendation is to focus on quality control.
